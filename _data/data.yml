career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Originally a math major, I trained with **Dr. Calin Belta** (BU) and **Dr. Ron Weiss** 
      (MIT), earning my doctorate degree in bioinformatics from Boston University.
      After completing my postdoctoral research at University of Southern California, I joined 
      AstraZeneca as a bioinformatics scientist to further my career in biomedical research. 
      My primary research focuses on pipeline **automation**, application of **statistical** methods to omics 
      data analysis, as well as **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence** to stratify patients, 
      predict drug-target interactions, and assess drug toxicity.
